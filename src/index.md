  # You Probably Got a Link 

  If you’ve landed here, chances are I shared a direct link with you to a specific page—maybe a project idea, a write-up, a presentation, or something else I thought might be useful or interesting.

  This site is my personal hub for quickly putting together and sharing information in a web-friendly format. Each page is designed to stand on its own, with a unique and meaningful URL, tailored to the person or group I’m sharing it with and accessed directly via a shared link. Feel free to contact me at elijan@ejmastnak.com with any questions.
