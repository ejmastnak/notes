## Tasks I could perform

Assuming the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, I am available to work on the project full-time (e.g. cca 40 hours weekly, and longer if agreed on beforehand to meet milestone deadlines)

| Task | Estimated completion time |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Working protoboard | **3-4 weeks**, depending on when components arrive, available documentation, and choice of developing prototype on Raspberry Pi (much faster prototyping) vs nRF5340 (closer to final product) |
| Pre-Kickstarter landing page | **1 week**, or as fast as a few days if given a full Figma (or similar) design to implement in code. Domain name registration, hosting, and deployment included free. |
| Algorithm – Real-time feedback | **3 weeks** (rough estimate; depending on specifications) |
| Algorithm – Post-measurement analysis | **3-6 weeks** (depends heavily on scope of analysis, need for in-person testing on an actual bicycle, how many people we will measure, etc.) |
| App development (Cloud + UX) | **4-8 weeks**, depending on scope, and choice of web app with integrated cloud vs native mobile app with separate cloud |
| Product website | **2-4 weeks**, depending on scope, unlikely to be more than 1-2 weeks if given a full design to implement in code. Domain name registration, hosting, and deployment included (free for a static site, a few EUR monthly if using a backend and database).  |
| Firmware (BLE, haptics) | **4 weeks** (rough estimate; depending on exact specifications; assuming available documentation and data sheets) |

## Payment/compensation

I propose dividing into two stages:

- **Pre-Kickstarter:** something on the order of a few-hundred EUR payment to cover building and programming the prototype board; and landing page, contributions to copy and marketing, etc. as they evolve.
- **Post-Kickstarter:** To be decided after a month or so of working together, but for planning purposes, I propose two options:

  1. Stipend to cover a minimum wage (cca 1500 EUR bruto, monthly) plus equity
  1. Typical salary for an electronic engineer/programmer (by agreement based on [data from SiStat](https://pxweb.stat.si/SiStatData/pxweb/sl/Data/-/0711335S.PX/table/tableViewLayout2/) for e.g. `2152 Inženirji/inženirke elektronike`, `2512 Razvijalci/razvijalke programske opreme`, but e.g. 2500 - 3000 EUR bruto for reference)


Notes:

- I have a d.o.o. with which I can send formal invoices (lahko istavim davčno potrjene račune), i.e. there is a logistically straightforward way to pay me (i.e. you don't need to employ me, no need for *delo na črno*, etc.)
- Payment does not have to be strictly a monthly salary, but can be done on a contractual basis (e.g. XYZ EUR for milestone ABC), using estimated amount of work only as a reference
