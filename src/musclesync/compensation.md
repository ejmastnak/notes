# MuscleSync: Compensation

Assuming the Kickstarter campaign succeeds, I am available to work on the project full-time (e.g. cca 40 hours weekly, or by agreement).

I propose dividing compensation into two stages:

- **Pre-Kickstarter (protoboard + landing page):** one-time payment on the order of a few hundred EUR

- **Post-Kickstarter:** I propose two options:

  1. Either a stipend to cover a minimum wage (cca 1600 EUR monthly-ish to cover minimum bruto plača + stroški delodajalca) with equity...
  1. ...or a typical salary for an electronic engineer/programmer (by agreement with reference to [data from SiStat](https://pxweb.stat.si/SiStatData/pxweb/sl/Data/-/0711335S.PX/table/tableViewLayout2/) for e.g. `2152 Inženirji/inženirke elektronike`, `2512 Razvijalci/razvijalke programske opreme`, but e.g. 2500 - 3000 EUR bruto for reference)

Exact numbers of course subject to mutual agreement; these are as a rough reference.

Notes:

- I have a d.o.o. with which I can send formal invoices, so **there is a logistically straightforward way to pay me** (i.e. no need for *delo na črno*, no need to employ me via *pogodba o delovnem razmerju*, etc.)
- Payment does not have to be strictly a monthly salary — we can do payments on a contractual basis (e.g. XYZ EUR for completing milestone ABC)
