# MuscleSync: 2025-09-20 update

This is an analysis of measurements performed on 2025-09-16.

**The goal of the measurement session** was to test how well we could distinguish pedalling fast with minimum resistance on the stationary bike (light muscle output) from pedalling fast with maximum resistance.
The analysis methods tested are integration and differentiation.

**Takeaway:** Unfortunately, neither integration nor differentiation, at least from an initial analysis, do not seem to distinguish clearly between fast pedalling at maximum resistance and fast pedalling at minimum resistance.
Graphs, tables of integral and mean values, and the original CSV files for download are presented later in this report.

## Summary

We performed initial MC sensor measurements on a stationary bike the previous week.
We measured both Elijan and Alma.

For repeatability of future measurements, here is the measurement protocol:

- Equipment: stationary bike at Srdjan's apartment at Rimska 12
- Upor: MAX
- Seat height: setting 63
- Take baseline reading (for the purposes of computing MC sensor bias) with leg extended (i.e. with no tension in leg)
- Acquisition: sampled at 1 kHz with MC data logger on channel 1
- Sequence:
  1. maximum muscle output for 10 seconds at maximum bike resistance
  1. wait for MC data logger battery to recharge (2-3 minutes)
  1. pedalling as fast as possible for 10 seconds at *minimum* bike resistance

### Terminology

I will be calling the two output zones "**Max**" and "**Light**":

- **Max**: maximum output at the stationary bike's *maximum* resistance setting
- **Light**: pedalling as fast as possible at the stationary bike's *lowest* resistance setting

The goal of the measurements was to test how well we could distinguish pedalling fast with minimum resistance on the stationary bike (light muscle output) from pedalling fast with maximum resistance.

## Measurement data

All measurements are filtered with a 10 Hz, 5-th order Butterworth lowpass filter before analysis.

### Signal plots

The following graphs show the Alma and Elijan's MC signals at both maximum and light output.

#### Alma — MC signal

Below are Alma's MC signals at maximum and light output. The signal at maximum output appears a bit more jagged, with higher frequency components.

<Image :src="almaLightMcFiltImg" caption="Alma's MC signal, pedalling fast at light resistance." />

#### Elijan — MC signal

Below is Elijan's MC signal at maximum and light outputs. Note how the amplitude falls over time in the maximum output signal, indicating fatigue.

### Derivatives

The following graphs show the derivatives of Alma and Elijan's MC signals at both maximum and light output.

Summary: unfortunately, differentiation (at least naively, from a quick look at derivative amplitude) doesn't seem to clearly diagnose high muscle output (at max bike resistance) and simply faster pedalling (at minimal bike resistance).
For both Elijan and Alma, derivative amplitude is similar for both fast pedalling at maximum output and fast pedalling at minimal resistance.

#### Alma — Derivative

For Alma, the derivative has higher amplitude at *light* output, and the derivative at maximum output has a more jagged shape (it seems to have higher frequency components superimposed on the fundamental cadence frequency).

#### Elijan — Derivative

Maximum amplitude of the derivative is relatively similar at maximum and output, but the derivative minima are more pronounced at light output.

### Integrals and mean values

Summary: here, as in the initial measurements taken on 2025-09-05, integration doesn't seem to clearly diagnose high muscle output (at max bike resistance) and simply faster pedalling (at minimal bike resistance).
We see both cases: Elijan's integrals are larger for max output; Alma's integrals are larger for light output and fast pedalling.

More measurements across many subjects would be needed to create a robust algorithm, but this gives us some ideas to use as a starting point.

#### Alma

| Zone | Integral (above bias) | Integral (bias corrected) | Integral (raw) | Mean (above bias) | Mean (bias corrected) | Mean (raw) |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Light | 0.185 | 0.176 | 9.499 | 0.025 | 0.020 | 1.056 |
| Max | 0.104 | 0.103 | 7.389 | 0.016 | 0.015 | 1.056 |

#### Elijan

| Zone | Integral (above bias) | Integral (bias corrected) | Integral (raw) | Mean (above bias) | Mean (bias corrected) | Mean (raw) |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Light | 0.265 | 0.246 | 6.886 | 0.028 | 0.021 | 0.574 |
| Max | 0.279 | 0.277 | 5.879 | 0.030 | 0.028 | 0.588 |

#### Explanation of columns in table

- `Integral (above bias)`: area of a signal above the bias offset only (i.e. only portions of the signal above the bias offset contribute to the integral; other values are ignored)
- `Integral (bias corrected)`: integral of an entire signal after bias correcting the signal
- `Integral (raw)`: integral of a raw signal, before bias correction 

- `Mean (above bias)`: mean of a signal above the bias offset only (i.e. only portions of the signal above the bias offset contribute to the mean; other values are ignored)
- `Mean (bias corrected)`: mean of an entire signal after bias correcting the signal
- `Mean (raw)`: mean of a raw signal, before bias correction
