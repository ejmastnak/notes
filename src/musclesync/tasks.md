## Tasks I can complete

| Task | Estimated completion time |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| Proof-of-concept protoboard | **October 1** |
| Pre-Kickstarter landing page | **1 week**, or as fast as **a few days** if given a Figma (or similar) design to implement in code. Domain name registration, hosting, and deployment included. |
| Algorithm – Real-time feedback | **3 weeks** (rough estimate; depending on specifications) |
| Algorithm – Post-measurement analysis | **3 weeks** (rough estimate; depending on specifications) |
| App development (Cloud + UX) | **4-8 weeks**, depending on scope, and choice of web app with integrated cloud vs native mobile app with separate cloud |
| Product website | **2-4 weeks**, depending on scope, unlikely to be more than **1-2 weeks** if given a design to implement in code. Domain name registration, hosting, and deployment included (free for a static site, a few EUR monthly if using a backend and database).  |
| Firmware (BLE, haptics) | **4 weeks** (rough estimate; depending on exact specifications; assuming available documentation and data sheets) |
